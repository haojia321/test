				First, I would like to introduce <b>“Little Red Crowned Crane.”</b> The
				dancer’s name is Elena and has studied hard under Mrs. Xuejuan, a dance
				teacher. She practices her dances almost every day and has shown
				dedication and talent for her lovely performances.
				<img src="/images/gallery/03012025/4.jpg" alt="photo" class="h-80 md:h-160 w-full md:w-3/4 rounded-lg object-cover mt-2" />
				<br /><br />
				I would also like to talk about the next performer, Michelle. She is a
				dancer who started at the age of just five, winning many awards in the U.S.
				She has shown passion for her dances and loves it as well. She performed
				<b>A Thousand Years</b>, by Christina Perri. She also performed <b>Turn Your
				Face</b>, a little mix.
				<img src="/images/gallery/03012025/3.jpg" alt="photo" class="h-80 md:h-160 w-full md:w-3/4 rounded-lg object-cover mt-2" />
				<br /><br />
				Next, I will be talking about Joseph Pei. He is good at playing the
				violin and knows how to do Kung Fu. He has been studying under Mrs.
				Diao and has made a lot of progress. He played <b>L. Boccherini’s Minuet</b>,
				an amazingly performed piece.
				<img src="/images/gallery/03012025/9.jpg" alt="photo" class="h-80 md:h-160 w-full md:w-3/4 rounded-lg object-cover mt-2" />
				<br /><br />
				I would additionally talk about Jason, a piano player who started
				when he was about 7 years old with Mrs. Margarita. He played <b>Ode to Joy</b>
				and <b>Soccer is My Favorite</b>. They were both wonderful pieces for the
				audience.
				<br /><br />
				Along with Jason, I would like to talk about his older sister, Yuxin. She
				is a talented piano player and a violin player. She started piano at just five
				years old and has won many awards in the country. Her talents help her
				enjoy the music pieces and help the audience enjoy it too. Yuxin’s loving
				trait made her audience love it so much. She did the piano piece, <b>My Heart
				Will Go On</b>. She also played the violin, performing <b>Concerto in B Minor</b>.
				<br /><br />
				I would also like to talk about myself, Annie. I played the piano
				starting at about four years old. I really love piano and other musical
				instruments. I played <b>Bach’s Sinfonia, Scarlatti Sonata in C Major,
				Mozart’s Sonata</b>, and <b>Chopin Impromptu</b>.
				<img src="/images/gallery/03012025/1.jpg" alt="photo" class="h-80 md:h-160 w-full md:w-3/4 rounded-lg object-cover mt-2" />
				<br /><br />
				Following my performance, I’d like to talk about my little brother
				Aiden. He is also a piano player who started at age 5. Like me, he spends
				time practicing and won many awards here. He played <b>Bach’s Invention</b>
				and <b>Chopin Nocturne</b>.
				<img src="/images/gallery/03012025/10.jpg" alt="photo" class="h-80 md:h-160 w-full md:w-3/4 rounded-lg object-cover mt-2" />
				<br /><br />
				Lastly, I would like to talk about the Water Lily Dance Team. The girls
				there include Elena, Sophia Z, Angela, Olivia, Faith, Sophia T, and me as
				well. We performed a Chinese classical dance named <b>The Leaping Koi</b>.
				The koi is an imagery of those fish in traditional Chinese culture. The koi
				signifies great fortune, prosperity, and perseverance too. The movements
				of the fish illustrate the Koi’s graceful swimming and leaping motions in the
				water.
				<img src="/images/gallery/03012025/6.jpg" alt="photo" class="h-80 md:h-160 w-full md:w-3/4 rounded-lg object-cover mt-2" />
				<img src="/images/gallery/03012025/7.jpg" alt="photo" class="h-80 md:h-160 w-full md:w-3/4 rounded-lg object-cover mt-2" />
				<br /><br />
				Overall, the performances were amazing! I hope the audiences and
				performers enjoy it.
