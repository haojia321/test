Hi, my name is Sonja, and I’m going to tell you about Music Miracles! It gathers children who would like to play instruments, sing, or dance for the seniors that live in the senior center. I enjoy playing with my friends to bring joy to the audience and give back to the community.
<br /><br />
The senior center is a great place to express your emotions with music. When you go to the senior center, you are greeted by many nice people. Although they need people to take care of them because of mobility, they are kind, special, supportive, and cheerful. I play the violin, and my friend Xinxin plays piano. I duet with her a lot. Songs we’ve played together are Amazing Grace and Minuet 3. These two songs are usually the opening songs, because the audience are familiar with them. They can help warm up the audience. I also play violin for the waterlily song, adding graceful tones and sharing the love of motherhood, which is the focus of this piece. We will practice new songs every few months, so stay tuned! 
<br /><br />
The other exciting thing is that when you go to this place you can get volunteer hours. The more time you spend in this place, the more hours you get. Metals will be awarded to you if you meet the hour requirements. This encourages us to perform more often and brings recognition for our hard work.
<br /><br />
I love Music Miracles and performing for the lovely seniors because it is a nice way to connect with friends and audience. It can also reward us for our volunteer hours. I hope you learned more about Music Miracles. Come join us!
