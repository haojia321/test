Hi, my name is Sonja, and Iâ€™m going to share how Music Miracles helped me improve my music skills. At first, I was nervous to play music in front of people. My hands would sweat, and I worried about messing up. But the more I performed, the more confident I became. The seniors are so kind and supportive that even if I missed a note, they would smile and clap. This made me a better performer.
<br /><br />
Performing with my friends is also very fun. We support each other and focus on making music together. When I play violin with Yuxin on the piano, it is better than playing alone. The sound we make together is more lively and energetic. And if I make a mistake, we will just laugh it off. Soon, the fear of the stage turned into excitement. I started to enjoy the feeling of sharing music, instead of being afraid.
<br /><br />
Each performance makes me better and more confident. Now, I look forward to our concerts because I can play with my friends and share music. I am grateful that Music Miracles gives me a chance to perform with my friends and practice courage.
