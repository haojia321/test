Hello! I'm Ethan Zhang, and I'm still so excited to tell you all about the Music Miracles concert!  It was a great day, and I loved watching all the amazing performances with piano, violin, singing, and even dancing! It made my heart feel so happy.
The concert was on Saturday, August 16th. We had so many great shows! The first one was Jason and Yuxin Jia playing a piano duet called "Amazing Grace." It was so peaceful and beautiful. Then, Jason played the piano all by himself, and he was so good! He played a song called "Sonatina in C Major." It was like a happy little song that made me want to smile.
Next, Jason and Yuxin came back and played another piano duet called "The Band Played On." After that, Shannon Chen played two songs on the piano: "The Marine Hymn" and "Tarantula." She was so brave to play two songs! Then it was my turn, and I was a little bit nervous but also excited! I played a sonatina on the piano for 2 minutes. It felt great!

Then, Anne Tang, Jason Jia, Yuxin Jia, and Michelle Zheng all played and sang a song together called "A Thousand Years." Their voices were so pretty, and it was a super sweet song. After that, Yiyi Liu played the violin so beautifully. She played a song called "Sonata No. 3." It sounded like a magical fairy tale.
Then Mandi Wang sang a song from a play called "The Phantom of the Opera." It was called "Think of Me," and her voice was so powerful, it gave me goosebumps! Ryan Chen played two songs on the piano, and so did Yuxin Jia! We also had so many other friends playing and singing. Michelle Zheng even danced to her song, "Turn Your Face." It was so cool to see her dance!
The concert was amazing! I felt so proud of all my friends, and it was so much fun to perform.
