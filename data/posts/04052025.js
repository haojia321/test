The Music Miracles concert was a wonderful chance for performers of all ages to share their passion for music through piano, violin, and singing at a senior community center. This program was to perform to the seniors to bring them joy and peace.
<br /><br />

Our first performance was a piano and violin duet performed by myself and Sonja. I am turning twelve and Sonja is turning 10 in May. The piece was called Amazing Grace. Sonja played the violin while I played the piano. Sonja has been learning the violin for four years and I’ve played piano since I was five years old.
<br /><br />

Next up my brother Jason. Jason is seven years old and he has been playing the piano for less than a year, but that didn’t prevent him from sounding great. Today, he played Minuet and Trio. After his performance, we played a piano duet to the song Greetings. 
<br /><br />

After that, nine year old Allison performed Appaloosa on the piano and she did beautiful and amazingly!
<br /><br />

Then it was Angela’s turn. Angela is also nine years old. Today she played a beautiful piece-Clementi Sonatina Op. 36, No.3. 
<br /><br />

Now we had our first vocal performance of our program. Jason and I sang while eleven year old Annie played the duet on the piano. We sang A Thousand Years by Christina Perri. The song was also played in the movie film Twilight, describing Edward and Bella’s love affair.
<br /><br />

After that, Annie’s little brother Aiden,who is eight years old and a third grader at Colvin Run elementary school, played a few pieces on the piano. He played Bach Invention, Scarlatti Sonata, and Chopin Nocturne. He played them as beautiful pieces of music to enjoy.
<br /><br />

Other than piano, I also enjoy playing the violin. So today, I played Gavotte in D major on the violin. I have only been playing for less than a year, studying under Ms. Diao. 
<br /><br />

Now we enjoyed a beautiful and touching Chinese song called Daylily. This song is originally from a Chinese movie called Hello, Mother. This song is about the love a mother has for her children. Once again, Annie played the piano with her brother Aiden while Elena, Angela, Allison, and Sophia sang. I think from this song we all learned about how much your mother loves you and how you should love her back.
<br /><br />

After the beautiful vocal piece, I played the piano. I am a 6th grader in Eagle Ridge Middle school and I have been playing the piano for more than six years. I have even been invited to perform at Carnegie Hall! Today, I played Mozart Sonata in F Major by Mozart and River Flows In You by Yiruma. Both are elegant pieces. The song River Flows In You is a work representing the fruition of love and how love can grow between people.
<br /><br />

After me, Ryan played a touching piano Nocturne, Chopin Nocturne in F Minor. Ryan is a sixth grader at Colvin Run Elementary School. And then, he played the piano version of Take Me Home, Country Roads while Allison, Jason, and myself sang along. Originally, Ryan’s little sister Shannon was supposed to sing, but she couldn’t come, so the three of us substituted for her.
<br /><br />

Now Sonja played Bouree on the violin. She too studies under Ms. Diao. Sonja is nine years old and is turning ten in May. She enjoys participating in the S.A.Y. band where she and her friends including me perform in senior community centers to raise money for charity.
<br /><br />

Anne is a talented pianist who began learning piano at the age of five. She has gone to many national competitions and has even been invited to perform at Carnegie Hall! Today, she performed Bach’s Sinfonia, Scarlatti Sonata, and Mozart Sonata KV457.
<br /><br />

For our last performance, Erica played the Guzheng, a traditional Chinese musical instrument featuring a long, rectangular soundboard with strings stretched across it, played by plucking with both hands. She played the piece Love of Yunnan, a beautiful and elegant piece of music.
<br /><br />

This concert was a truly special experience. I hope we can bring Music Miracles to an even further level and invite more people to come show off their talents, whether it's singing, piano, violin, or other instruments. We hope to perform again another time soon!
