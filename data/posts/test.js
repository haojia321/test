The Music Miracles concert was a wonderful chance for performers of all ages to share their passion for music and movement through piano, violin, and a special kungfu demonstration at a senior community center. This program was to perform to the seniors to bring them joy and peace.

Our first performer was Jason, my 7 year-old brother, has been playing piano for only a few months now, but he did amazing on stage. To kick off our concert, he played ‘Ode to Joy’, and ‘Soccer is my Favorite’ for us. Right after him, I played Concerto in B minor on the violin with a piano accompaniment. I am 11 years old and I’ve been playing the violin for a few months. Besides violin, I also played My Heart Will Go On on the piano. I’ve been playing piano for over 6 years now and I’ve even been invited to play at Carnegie Hall!

The concert featured a special performance beyond music—a Chinese martial arts (kungfu) demonstration by Joseph. A talented martial artist, Joseph has won multiple championships and a silver medal in staff at the University Wushu Games. His performance was both powerful and graceful, showcasing the beauty of Chinese Wushu.

Following Avery, we had Aiden, who is also an 8 year old and began learning piano at the age of 5 with Mrs. Margarita. Aiden has won numerous prizes in music, and has even gotten first place at the Virginia State Audition and won the title of best performer at YMIC. He played Bach’s Invention, Mozart Sonata and Chopin Nocturne. His sister, Annie,also started piano at 5 years old and since then has won top prizes in Virginia, Maryland, and national competitions. Annie has even been invited to play at Carnigie Hall!!! She performed Bach’s Sinfonia 15, Mozarts’ Sonata KV 457, Movement 1, and Chopin Impromptu. Both of them are very talented and we really enjoyed their performance.
