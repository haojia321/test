Our visit to Meadowlark Botanical Gardens was not only a fun outing but also a meaningful way to help the environment. We spent the day picking up trash and removing sticks and branches that could interfere with mowing the grass. Everyone had a great time working together in the fresh air!
<br /><br />

When we first arrived, a staff member explained our responsibilities: collect any litter we found and remove twigs or fallen branches along the paths and grassy areas. Most of us also performed in the Music Miracles concert later that day. The group included Anne and her brother Aiden, Michelle and her brother Ethan, my brother Jason and me, Erica and her sister Sophia, as well as Sonja, Elena, and Allyson. Thanks to everyone’s effort, the garden was noticeably cleaner and more welcoming for future visitors.

<br /><br />
As we worked, we were surrounded by nature’s beauty—bright, colorful flowers like tulips, bluebells, and daylilies filled the garden. We spotted turtles resting by the pond and saw giant fish swimming gracefully in the water. We also came across a peaceful lake with a fountain, where several families were enjoying a picnic.
<br /><br />
Even though our cleanup eventually came to an end, the fun didn’t stop there. Anne’s parents treated us all to pizza and drinks, and we enjoyed our meal together outside like one big family.
<br /><br />
This was truly an unforgettable experience. I hope the garden staff appreciated our contribution, and I look forward to doing something like this again in the future!
