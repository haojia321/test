Hello, everyone! My name is Ethan Zhang, and I want to tell you about the Music Miracles concert from August 2nd!  It was so much fun, and I think everyone did an amazing job!
The first performance was by Sonja Wilson and Yuxin Jia, and they played a violin and piano duet called "Amazing Grace." It was so sweet and calming. Then, Sonja Wilson played the violin all by herself, and the song was called "Minuet 3." She looked so happy playing her violin!
<br /><br/>
After that, Jason Jia and Yuxin Jia played a piano duet called "Greetings." Next, Jason Jia played a song on the piano by himself called "Sonatina in C Major." I could tell he worked really hard on it. Then, it was my turn! I was a little bit shy but also so ready to play my sonatina on the piano for 2 minutes. It was so exciting to be on stage!
<br /><br/>
After I played, Anne Tang, Jason Jia, Yuxin Jia, and Michelle Zheng all played and sang a song together called "A Thousand Years." They sounded so perfect together, like a chorus of angels!
<br /><br/>
A lot of people played and sang in the second half of the concert, too. The last person to perform was Erica Zheng. She played the Gu Zheng instrument and it sounded so pretty and special! She played a song called "I and My Motherland."
<br /><br/>
It was such a great day, and I was so happy to see all my friends and family there. I felt so happy and thankful for the chance to play music. I hope everyone had a wonderful time!
